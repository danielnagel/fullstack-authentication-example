# Local authentication example with express and nextjs using TypeScript

> âš  Currently under Development!

## Used Frameworks

* TypeScript
* Express
* Mongoose
* Jest
* Passport
* JWT

## Idea

I was searching for an example project doing exactly what i wanted.
Authentication between NextJS Frontend and Express Backend using TypeScript.
I found an project which is splitted in [Back](https://github.com/alan2207/express-server-jwt)
and [Frontend](https://github.com/alan2207/nextjs-jwt-authentication), but it wasn't written with TypeScript.
So I decided to rewrite it in TypeScript and also add some testing.
